Misc-PowerShell
===============

Random PowerShell scripts created for various purposes.  Most are not documented, probably never will be.
These are not meant to be pretty or efficient.  They were meant to fill a need, one that occurred as I began
(and am still going through) my journey learning PowerShell, as well as during my day to day admin tasks with
the number of different networks I maintain.  Most will have functions, sometimes run within the script.  The
unctions can also be run outside of the script too if dot sourced (as well a few other methods I can't 
remember right now).
